# AWS DynamoDB Watermark Backend

The AWS DynamoDB watermark backend provides a robust, distributed solution for watermark tracking in Signatory. This backend is particularly valuable for high-availability setups and production environments where reliability is critical.

> For a general introduction to watermarks and why they're important, see the [Watermarks Overview](watermarks.md).

## Why Use AWS DynamoDB for Watermarks?

AWS DynamoDB offers several benefits as a watermark backend:

1. **High Availability**: DynamoDB is a fully managed, highly available database service with built-in redundancy.

2. **Concurrency Support**: DynamoDB provides strong consistency for reads and conditional writes, ensuring accurate watermark tracking across multiple Signatory instances.

3. **Scalability**: DynamoDB can handle any volume of watermark tracking data with predictable performance.

4. **Cloud-Native Integration**: If you're already using AWS services, DynamoDB integrates seamlessly with your infrastructure.

5. **Reliability**: DynamoDB offers global tables, point-in-time recovery, and backup options to protect your watermark data.

## Configuration

Below is the minimum configuration required to use DynamoDB as a watermark backend:

```yaml
watermark:
  driver: aws
  config:
    access_key_id: <aws_access_key_id>
    secret_access_key: <aws_secret_access_key>
    region: <aws_region>
```

When the backend is initialized, it will create a table named `watermark` if it doesn't exist.

## Configuration Parameters

| Name              | Type   | Required | Description                                                         |
|-------------------|--------|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| access_key_id     | string | OPTIONAL | IAM user detail for accessing DynamoDB                              |
| secret_access_key | string | OPTIONAL | IAM user detail for accessing DynamoDB                              |
| region            | string | âœ…       | AWS region where the DynamoDB table is located                      |
| table             | string | OPTIONAL | Name of the DynamoDB table to use for watermark tracking (default: `watermark`) |

## Environment Variables Support

The `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, and `region` fields can also be set using the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

The `table` parameter defaults to `watermark` but can be overridden in the configuration file.

## Best Practices for High-Availability Setups

When using DynamoDB for watermarks in a high-availability setup:

1. **Same Table**: Ensure all Signatory instances use the same DynamoDB table.

2. **IAM Permissions**: The IAM user or role needs read and write permissions to the DynamoDB table. Consider using the following minimal IAM policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:CreateTable"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/watermark"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Region Proximity**: For best performance, use a DynamoDB table in the same region as your Signatory instances.

4. **Monitoring**: Monitor the DynamoDB table's throughput metrics and consider enabling auto-scaling if needed.

5. **Backups**: Enable point-in-time recovery for the DynamoDB table to protect against data loss.

## How DynamoDB Watermarks Work

The DynamoDB backend implements concurrent signing protection through a mechanism of conditional writes:

1. When a signing request arrives, Signatory reads the current watermark from DynamoDB
2. It validates if the operation can be signed based on level and round comparison
3. If valid, it attempts to update the watermark using a conditional write that only succeeds if the stored watermark hasn't changed
4. If another instance has updated the watermark in the meantime, the condition fails, and the process repeats

This mechanism ensures that only one instance can successfully sign and record a watermark for a specific level/round, even when multiple instances try simultaneously.

```mermaid

    participant Baker1 as Baker/Node 1
    participant Signatory1 as Signatory Instance 1
    participant DynamoDB as DynamoDB Table
    participant Signatory2 as Signatory Instance 2
    participant Baker2 as Baker/Node 2

    Note over Baker1, Baker2: Both bakers receive same block (level 100)
    
    par Baker 1 asks for signature
        Baker1->>Signatory1: Sign block level 100
        Signatory1->>+DynamoDB: GetItem(key=pkh/chain)
        DynamoDB-->>-Signatory1: Current watermark (level 99)
        
        Signatory1->>Signatory1: Validate level 100 > 99
        Note over Signatory1: Validation passes
        
        Signatory1->>+DynamoDB: PutItem with condition<br>(current level still == 99)
        Note over DynamoDB: Condition passes
        DynamoDB-->>-Signatory1: Success (watermark updated)
        
        Signatory1->>Signatory1: Sign operation
        Signatory1-->>Baker1: Return signature
    and Baker 2 asks for signature
        Baker2->>Signatory2: Sign block level 100
        Signatory2->>+DynamoDB: GetItem(key=pkh/chain)
        DynamoDB-->>-Signatory2: Current watermark (level 99)
        
        Signatory2->>Signatory2: Validate level 100 > 99
        Note over Signatory2: Validation passes
        
        Note over Signatory1, DynamoDB: Meanwhile, Instance 1 updates watermark
        
        Signatory2->>+DynamoDB: PutItem with condition<br>(current level still == 99)
        Note over DynamoDB: Condition fails<br>(level is now 100)
        DynamoDB-->>-Signatory2: ConditionalCheckFailedException
        
        Note over Signatory2: Retry cycle begins
        Signatory2->>+DynamoDB: GetItem(key=pkh/chain)
        DynamoDB-->>-Signatory2: Current watermark (level 100)
        
        Signatory2->>Signatory2: Validate level 100 = 100
        Note over Signatory2: Validation fails<br>(same level)
        
        Signatory2-->>Baker2: Return ErrWatermark
    end
    
    Note over Baker1, Baker2: Only Baker 1 received a signature<br>Double baking prevented
```

The diagram above illustrates how the DynamoDB watermark mechanism prevents double signing even when multiple Signatory instances receive signing requests simultaneously, effectively protecting against slashing penalties.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Access Denied Errors**: Verify your IAM permissions and credentials.

2. **Latency**: If you experience high latency, ensure your DynamoDB table is in the same region as your Signatory instances.

3. **Throttling**: If you receive throttling errors, consider provisioning more read/write capacity for your DynamoDB table or enabling auto-scaling.

### Monitoring

Monitor your DynamoDB table's performance using AWS CloudWatch. Key metrics to watch include:

- ConsumedReadCapacityUnits
- ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits
- ThrottledRequests

## Cost Considerations

DynamoDB charges based on provisioned throughput and storage. For most Signatory deployments, the watermark table requires minimal resources, making it a cost-effective solution. Consider using on-demand pricing for small to medium deployments.
