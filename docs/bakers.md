# How to use Signatory with a Tezos Baker

A Tezos baker can use Signatory as a remote signer with keys stored securely in enterprise vaults (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, YubiHSM, etc.) or locally in files for evaluation purposes only. This guide shows a **Local Secret** setup for evaluation; production deployments should use proper vault implementations.

## Bakers on Tezos Networks

**Prerequisites**

- A working `octez-client` and `octez-baker` ([installation guide](https://octez.tezos.com/docs/introduction/howtoget.html))
- A local Tezos node with accessible RPC (e.g. `http://localhost:8732`) - see [Octez baker setup](https://octez.tezos.com/docs/introduction/howtorun.html#baker) for installation
- The baker's public key hash (PKH), e.g. `tz1...` (we use `baking_key` as the alias in examples)

**Verify the node is ready**

```bash
# Node bootstrap status
curl -s http://localhost:8732/chains/main/is_bootstrapped

# Or via the client (also ensures your client points at the right node)
octez-client --endpoint http://localhost:8732 bootstrapped
````

**List known addresses**

```bash
octez-client list known addresses
```

**Show the baker address**

```bash
octez-client show address baking_key
```

**Fund and register the delegate**

Wait until the node is bootstrapped, then fund the implicit account (use a faucet on testnets). Check balance:

```bash
octez-client get balance for baking_key
```

Register as a delegate (optionally set a consensus key):

```bash
# register the implicit account as a delegate
octez-client register key baking_key as delegate

# OR register baking_key as a delegate but use a separate consensus key
# (first create the consensus key if it doesn't exist)
octez-client register key baking_key as delegate with consensus key consensus_key
```

**Stake funds for baking:**

After registration, you must stake funds to participate in baking:

```bash
# Stake tez for baking (adjust amount as needed)
octez-client stake 10000 for baking_key
```

**Check rights**

Modern terminology uses **baking** and **attesting** (formerly "endorsing"). The RPC to query attesting rights is `attestation_rights`. (The older `endorsing_rights` was deprecated.)

```bash
# Baking rights (you may need to provide a future cycle)
octez-client rpc get "/chains/main/blocks/head/helpers/baking_rights?cycle=<cycle>&delegate=<pkh>"

# Attestation rights (preferred modern name)
octez-client rpc get "/chains/main/blocks/head/helpers/attestation_rights?cycle=<cycle>&delegate=<pkh>"
```

**Terminology Note:** Tezos protocol terminology evolved from "endorsement" to "attestation" (and "preendorsement" to "preattestation"). Signatory policy configuration supports both terminologies, but this guide uses the modern terms to stay current with protocol naming.

**Start the baker**

```bash
# Modern agnostic baker (automatically detects protocol)
octez-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass consensus_key

# For DAL participation, include companion key:
octez-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node \
  --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass \
  --dal-node http://localhost:10732 \
  consensus_key companion_key
```

## Signatory

**Get Signatory using Docker (recommended):**

```bash
# Pull the latest Signatory Docker image
docker pull ecadlabs/signatory

# Or use a specific version
docker pull ecadlabs/signatory:v1.2.3
```

**Or download prebuilt binaries:**

Download the latest release binaries from the [Signatory GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ecadlabs/signatory/releases). Extract and install:

```bash
# Example for Linux x64 (check releases page for your platform)
wget https://github.com/ecadlabs/signatory/releases/download/v1.2.3/signatory_1.2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf signatory_1.2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv signatory* /usr/local/bin/
```



### Local Secret Vault (Development Only)

:::caution Development Only Warning
File-based secrets are **ONLY** for development and testing. **Never use in production.** For production deployments, use proper vault solutions like AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Key Management Service, or YubiHSM for secure key storage and management.
:::

Create `/etc/secret.json` with the bakerâ€™s secret **(example only; never publish real keys):**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "tz1YourBakerAddress",
    "value": "unencrypted:edskYourDevOnlySecretKey"
  }
]
```

Create `local_secret.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  address: :6732
  utility_address: :9583

vaults:
  local_secret:
    driver: file
    config:
      file: /etc/secret.json
      
  tezos:
  tz1YourBakerAddress:
    log_payloads: true
    allow:
      block:
      attestation:        # Modern terminology (was "endorsement") 
      preattestation:     # Modern terminology (was "preendorsement")
      generic:
        - reveal
        - delegation
        - transaction
        - stake
```

Start Signatory:

```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
docker run -d --name signatory \
  -p 6732:6732 -p 9583:9583 \
  -v $(pwd)/local_secret.yaml:/local_secret.yaml \
  -v /etc/secret.json:/etc/secret.json \
  ecadlabs/signatory serve -c /local_secret.yaml

# Or if using prebuilt binary
signatory serve -c local_secret.yaml
```

Test it:

```bash
# Get public key via remote signer HTTP interface
curl -s localhost:6732/keys/tz1YourBakerAddress
# -> {"public_key":"edpk..."}
```

Point `octez-client` at Signatory (remote signer):

```bash
octez-client import secret key baking_key http://localhost:6732/tz1YourBakerAddress --force
cat ~/.tezos-client/secret_keys
# [{"name":"baking_key","value":"http://localhost:6732/tz1YourBakerAddress"}]
```

(Octez's remote signer uses HTTP endpoints like `GET/POST /keys/<pkh>` under the hood.)

Try an operation and observe Signatory logs:

```bash
octez-client transfer 10 from baking_key to tz1RecipientAddress
```

## Other Vault Types

All enterprise vaults follow the same pattern:

1. **Configure the vault driver** under `vaults:` (KMS/HSM connection settings)
2. **List/activate keys** and copy the PKH from `signatory-cli list` into the `tezos:` section
3. **Import the key endpoint** into `octez-client` via `http://<signatory>:6732/<pkh>`
4. **Bake** as usual

See the official [Signatory documentation](https://signatory.io/docs/) for AWS/GCP/Azure/YubiHSM examples.

### Vault Selection Guidelines

* **Local Secret:** Development and testing only - **never for production**
* **Cloud KMS (AWS/GCP/Azure):** Enterprise production deployments with cloud HSM backing
* **YubiHSM:** On-premises hardware security module for enterprise setups
* **Other options:** See [Signatory vault documentation](https://signatory.io/docs/) for additional vault types

## Baking with DAL (Data Availability Layer)

The Data Availability Layer (DAL) enables data publication outside of Layer 1 blocks while maintaining decentralization. DAL participation **earns additional incentives** (10% of participation rewards) and **supports the Tezos X roadmap**.

:::danger Critical: BLS Keys Use Different Encoding
**BLS keys (tz4) use tag 41 encoding for ALL attestations.** Both consensus and companion keys receive identical bytes and decode to `request=attestation` in Signatory logs. **Do NOT configure `attestation_with_dal` for tz4 keys** - it has no effect and will cause confusion.

**Non-BLS keys (tz1/tz2/tz3) with DAL node:** Use `attestation_with_dal` permission (tag 23). These keys can participate in DAL but typically attest with bitset 0.

**See [DAL & BLS Attestations guide](dal_bls_attestations.md) for detailed explanation.**
:::

### Quick Setup

**1. Configure Signatory Policy**

```yaml
tezos:
  # Consensus key (tz4)
  tz4YourConsensusKey:
    log_payloads: true
    allow:
      block:
      attestation:       # Tag 41 - all attestations
      preattestation:    # Tag 40

  # Companion key (tz4) 
  tz4YourCompanionKey:
    log_payloads: true
    allow:
      attestation:       # Tag 41 - only permission needed
```

**2. Set Keys**

```bash
# Set consensus and companion keys for your delegate
octez-client set consensus key for <manager_key> to <consensus_key>
octez-client set companion key for <manager_key> to <companion_key>
```

**3. Start Baker with DAL**

```bash
octez-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node \
  --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass \
  --dal-node http://localhost:10732 \
  consensus_key companion_key
```

### Key Requirements

- **BLS consensus key (tz4)** - Needs `attestation` and `preattestation` permissions
- **BLS companion key (tz4)** - Needs `attestation` permission only (never signs preattestations)
- **DAL node** - Must be running and synced
- **Baker command** - Must include `--dal-node` flag and both key aliases

### What to Expect

**Consensus key** signs whenever baker has attestation rights (regardless of DAL).  
**Companion key** signs only when baker has attestation rights **AND** DAL content is available.

Both keys receive **identical tag 41 bytes** and decode to `request=attestation` in Signatory logs. DAL participation happens through weighted BLS aggregation after signing, not through different operation types.

### Troubleshooting

**"Companion tz4 key never signs"**
- Check DAL node is synced: `curl http://localhost:10732/level`
- Verify baker has `--dal-node` flag
- Confirm `attestation` permission in companion key policy (NOT `attestation_with_dal`)

**"Two tz4 signatures with same magic byte"**
- **This is correct for BLS DAL.** Baker sends identical tag 41 bytes to both keys. Both decode to `attestation`. See [DAL & BLS Attestations](dal_bls_attestations.md)

**"Not earning DAL rewards"**
- Check participation: `octez-client rpc get "/chains/main/blocks/head/context/delegates/YOUR_PKH/participation"`
- Look for `dal_attested_slots` > 0

## Protocol-Agnostic Baker Commands

Recent Octez versions include protocol-agnostic baker commands that automatically detect the current network protocol, eliminating the need to specify protocol-specific binary names.

**Modern Agnostic Commands:**

```bash
# Use the agnostic baker (automatically detects protocol)
octez-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass consensus_key

# For DAL participation, include companion key:
octez-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node \
  --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass \
  --dal-node http://localhost:10732 \
  consensus_key companion_key

# The agnostic baker replaces protocol-specific commands like:
# octez-baker-PsQuebec, octez-baker-PsNairob, octez-baker-alpha, etc.
```

**Agnostic Accuser:**

```bash
# Use the agnostic accuser 
octez-accuser run

# No need for protocol-specific accusers anymore
```

**Benefits:**

- **Automatic protocol detection**: No need to know current protocol hash
- **Seamless upgrades**: Works across protocol transitions
- **Simplified operations**: One command works on any network
- **Future-proof**: Commands remain valid as protocols evolve

**Migration Note:**

If you're using older protocol-specific commands, you can migrate to agnostic ones without changing your Signatory configuration. The remote signer interface remains the same.
