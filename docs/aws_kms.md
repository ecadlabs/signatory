# AWS KMS Configuration

Create an asymmetric key with usage as "sign and verify" in your AWS account.

Search for IAM and create a user with "Programmatic access" for Signatory to access the key resources. Save the details at the end which will be given only once on creation of the user.

## AWS KMS backend

Below are the minimum configuration required.

```yaml
vaults:
  aws:
    driver: awskms
    config:
      user_name: <iam_username>
      access_key_id: <aws_access_key_id>
      secret_access_key: <aws_secret_access_key>
      region: <aws_region>
```

### Configuration parameters

Name | Type | Required | Description
-----|------|:--------:|------------
user_name | string |✅| IAM user name
access_key_id | string | OPTIONAL | IAM user detail
secret_access_key | string | OPTIONAL | IAM user detail
region | string | ✅ | Region where key is created

The fields `access_key_id` & `secret_access_key` can be set in the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` respectively.

Import command is not available for aws as there is no support for asymmetric keys in AWS KMS. (Ref: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>)
