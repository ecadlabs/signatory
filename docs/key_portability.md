# Trade-offs around Key Portability and Key Security

This page discusses the trade-offs between key portability and key security. Key import is a feature that supports key portability.

Key portability refers to moving keys between different systems or devices. This can be useful for backup, disaster recovery, and migrating to a new system. On the other hand, key security refers to the ability to securely store and manage keys to prevent unauthorized access.

There are trade-offs to consider when designing a system that must balance key portability and security. Here are a few key considerations:

## Security

Security is always the top priority when it comes to cryptographic keys. A system that prioritizes key portability over key security may sacrifice security to make it easier to move keys between systems. On the other hand, a system that prioritizes key security over key portability may require more secure methods for importing keys, such as secure channels or physical transfer.

## Compatibility

When it comes to key portability, compatibility is an important consideration. Keys should be compatible between different systems and devices and should be stored in a format that is widely recognized and accepted. Key import may require additional steps to ensure compatibility, such as converting keys to a different format or ensuring that the importing system supports the same cryptographic algorithms as the exporting system.

## Complexity

Key portability can add complexity to a system, as it may require additional steps and processes to ensure that keys are properly moved between systems. Key import can also add complexity, as it may require additional security measures and validation steps to ensure the imported keys are legitimate.

## Use Cases

It's important to consider the specific use cases for key portability and key security. In some cases, key portability may be more important, such as in disaster recovery scenarios where the ability to quickly recover keys is critical. In other cases, key security may be more important, such as when working with third-party systems or importing keys for a specific purpose.

# Examples of Trade-offs between Key Portability and Key Security

To better understand the trade-offs between key portability and key security, let's consider a few examples:

## Example 1: Cloud-Based Storage

A company wants to use cloud-based storage to store encrypted data. The company needs to balance the need for key portability with the need for security.

If the company prioritizes key portability, it may use a cloud-based storage service to move keys between systems easily. However, this may come at the cost of security, as the keys may be more vulnerable to theft or interception during transport.

If the company prioritizes security, it may use a cloud-based storage service that requires a more secure method of importing keys, such as physical transfer or secure channels. This may make it more difficult to move keys between systems, but it ensures that the keys are protected from theft or interception.

## Example 2: Third-Party Integration

A company wants to integrate a third-party service that requires access to the company's encrypted data. The company needs to balance the need for key imports with the need for security.

If the company prioritizes key import, it may provide third-party service access to its keys. This may make it easier to integrate the service, but it also increases the risk of the keys being compromised if the third-party service experiences a security breach.

If the company prioritizes security, it may choose to keep the keys separate from the third-party service and instead provide the service with access to the encrypted data only. This makes it more difficult to integrate the service, but it ensures that the keys remain protected.

## Example 3: Disaster Recovery

A company wants to ensure that it can quickly recover its keys during a disaster. The company needs to balance the need for key portability with the need for security.

If the company prioritizes key portability, it may choose to store its keys in a format that is widely recognized and accepted, and it may use a cloud-based service that allows them to quickly recover its keys in the event of a disaster. However, this may come at the cost of security, as the keys may be more vulnerable to theft or interception during transport.

If the company prioritizes security, it may store its keys in a more secure format and only allow a limited number of individuals to access them. This may make it more difficult to quickly recover the keys in a disaster, but it ensures they remain protected.
